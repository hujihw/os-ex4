FILES:
MapReduceFramework.cpp- The implementation of MapReduceFramework library
Search.cpp- A program that searches for a substring in file names.
Makefile- compiles MapReduceFramework.cpp into a library,
		    creates an execution file for Search that uses our library,

README- this file.

REMARKS:

our framework design:
we chose the containers which are shared to be global. we hold in a vector a mutexes for each map thread created.
we hold a vector- std::vector<std::pair<pthread_t, std::pair<list<pair<k2Base *, v2Base *>> *,pthread_mutex_t *>>>.
through a locking a shared mutex each map thread adds itself to this vector. when a map thread reads data from the
in list it locks an index that signs what is the next data to read from the in list.
we used pthread_equal function for the emit func (for knowing what thread is running) as it is better that = operator.
the shuffle thread is waiting for a sign that he has data in one of the containers by use of pthread_cond_timed_wait.
when it is triggered it searches for a non empty list in the vector and when it finds one it competes for gaining
control of the list by locking its relevant mutex in the vector. the shuffle thread adds the list data to the
ShuffledMap which is- map<k2Base*, V2_LIST>. using join we ensure all of the map treads are deleted and then we
perform a last sweep over the lists and shuffle any data left. afterwards we merge the lists and sort them for the
desired output.

ANSWERS:

1. we propose the following design-
the runMapReduceFramework would create a pipe for each map thread it creates. we hold a list in the global scope that
stores the read file descriptors which the shuffle thread wil use and every map thread will get a write fd as a
parameter. every map thread can write the mapped data to the pipe using its relevant write fd. finally it will finish
the writing process when he will get a signal to stop. map threads will send through the pipe 2 pointers for key
and value that should be shuffled.

2.

3. We will go through every method and compare these attributes:
    a) Utilizing multi-cores
    b) Create a sophisticated scheduler
    c) Communication time (between different threads/processes)
    d) Ability to progress while one thread/process is blocked
    eOverall speed

(*) Single thread and a single process:

    a) There is no multi-core utilization because only
    one thread is available to the program.

    b) Also not relevant, because there is no
    meaning for scheduling one thread.

    c)  Not relevant.
